          <p>Hello there ðŸŒˆ! I am a full-stack developer seeking new professional opportunities in full-stack, back-end, or front-end development. I am naturally curious, detail-oriented, and passionate about finding creative solutions to problems, streamlining processes, and developing products that meet market needs. Collaborating with others is important to me as I enjoy learning from fresh perspectives.</p>
          <p>Lately, I've been focusing on enhancing my front-end skills, including practicing JavaScript, learning React, and exploring debugging tools like Chat GPT ðŸ¤“, which has proven to be a valuable resource.</p>
